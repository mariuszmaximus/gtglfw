### How to Share

Sharing our project is simple and can bring benefits to both you and us. The easiest and highly effective way is to link to our project on your online forums,
blogs, or other social media platforms. You can link directly to commits, issue reports, source files, or any other aspects you deem worth recommending to others.
This method is straightforward, very useful, and self-updating, allowing you to refer to our project. It's also the best way to express appreciation for our work
and acknowledge it, even if you can't support us financially or participate directly.

### How to Get Involved

- Ensure that you use the same coding style/formatting that is present in the project's updated files.
